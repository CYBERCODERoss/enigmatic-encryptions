# Encryption_v2 : Random Keys Generation (26 characters encryption)

In this version, I introduced random key generation as we learned srand and if statements in the university. And I figured that an encryption needs to be decrypted ofcourse, so I added a decrypter as well. 

## Concepts Used
- iostream.
- srand.
- if/else statements.
- Subtracting/adding ascii of characters.
- Displaying output.
